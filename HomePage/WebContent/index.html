<h1>My First Website</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
   Hi! My name is Yahui Zhou. I'm from Shanghai, China. (<a href="https://www.orangesmile.com/travelguide/shanghai/photo-gallery.htm">There are some 
   beautiful photos. </a>) I am a sophomore student.
   I majored in Education in STEM when I applied to the university because my
   parents think being a teacher is an awesome idea. I can be in a steady 
   profession. However, I known that I do not want to be a teacher. In order to 
   know about different majors and find my interest, I choose to take various GE 
   courses in the first two semesters. Fortunately, I found that I am interested 
   in coding after taking ENGR 1181. And since I love Math and Statistics, I 
   decide to transfer my major to Data Analytics.
